### Challenge 1

- [ ] Explore the Index.html page you downloaded.  Then, in the App.js file write code that will enable a user to customize your page - see the example I have provided in this file.  For every element specified with an _id_ you must prompt the user for a style or text, then use this information to customize the page.  Below is a list of all the id elements you must modify with user input, but feel free to get as creative as you like!

	* body
		- prompt the user for a color

	* id = "foodLogoImage"
		- prompt the user for a width in px
		- use .width to change the width
		- prompt the user for a distance from the left margin as a %
		- use .marginLeft to set the distance from the left
	* id = "logoImage" 
		- prompt the user for a width in px
		- use .width to change the width

		- prompt the user for a border color
		- use .borderColor to change the color
		- prompt the user for a border width (thin, thick, or medium)
