# AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

## Create Task Overview

This performance task requires you to develop a program on a topic that interests you or one that solves a problem. During the completion of this performance task, you will iteratively design, implement, and test your program. You will also provide written responses to prompts about your program and specific code segments that are significant to the functionality of your program. While the development of your program may involve some form of collaboration with another student in your class, for example, in the planning, designing, or testing (debugging) part of the process. Your program development must also involve a significant amount of independent work, in particular, the development of the lists, alogrithms, and procdures that you select to use as part of your written response. 

## Program Requirements

Your program must demonstrate a variety of capabilities and implement several different language features that, when combined, produce a result that cannot be easily accomplished without computing tools and techniques. Your program should draw upon mathematical and logical concepts, such as use of numbers, variables, mathematical expressions with arithmetic operators, logical and Boolean operators and expressions, decision statements, iteration, and/or collections.

Your program must include the following: 

- [ ] User input using any of the following sources
        * User actions that trigger events (prompt, buttons, input fields, dropdown menu, etc)
        * A file
        * Online data stream

- [ ] Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose

- [ ] At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose where you have defined:

        * the procedure’s name
        * the return type (if necessary)
        * one or more parameters

- [ ] An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure 

- [ ] Calls to your student-developed procedure

- [ ] Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality

## Submitting your Create Task

- [ ] All program code must be submitted to GitHub and should include the following commentary, 

    * Thorough documentation of all parts of your code
    * Citations for any code segements you did not develop
    * Citations for any code segments you developed in collaboration with someone else

- [ ] A video demonstrating your program running must be submitted to College Board.  The video you submit must,  

    * Demonstrate input to your program
    * Demonstrate at least one aspect of the functionality of your program
    * Demonstrate output produced by your program 
    * Be saved as .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format
    * Be less than 1 minute
    * Be less than 30 MB
    * Your video MUST NOT include any distinguishing features - your voice, name, picture, etc.  

- [ ] A pdf of your program code must be submitted to College Board

- [ ] A pdf your your written responses must be submitted to College Board




__Your completed project must be submitted to College Board by April 30__.  This is the deadline imposed by the College Board, not Ms. Pluska.
